# Qv2ray-RemoteManagement
Remote management plugin for Qv2ray, use QtRemoteObjects and RESTful API

# Notice

The plugin is using my modified interface, and (for sure) it depends on a modified version of Qv2ray itself. This makes it incompatible with "Qv2ray/Qv2ray" or "Shadowsocks/Qv2ray".

## Changes

Way too many.

## Wait, it's GPL licensed with MIT interface.

Yes, changes will be published sometime in the future.
